    <h1>Digital Color and Design Habits</h1>
    <p>Freelance/consulting has provided me the opportunity to meet and work beside individuals with a range of experience, skills and spanning many industries. This blog has been a burning discussion I been wanting to write for a while.  Knowing essential toolsets for color management will create a better end product. And knowing how to ask proper questions helps our habits during our workflow.</p>
    <p>I welcome constructive feedback to help improve the understanding for all experience levels. This information might be a good refresher for those with industry experience and for others that are just now stepping into the ocean waters help to connect the dots. When talking about color within this article I will be relating the use of color in Graphic Design and Digital Printing. However, This article will touch on more than just colors for one industry and are some what adaptive for others.</p>

    <h2>Color as a Tool</h2>
    <h3>Developing an deeper understanding of Digital Color</h3>
    <p>To understand the abstract nature of RGB and CMYK I suggest thinking of color as a tool. Keep with me here, As designers we spend so much time developing our skills and techniques to showcase our designs for the world at large. Much of what we do is second nature or adapting our skills to meet the current trends of today. In many cases my experience dealing with designers, color is thought about as a end process that does not need much attention during the planning phase. Thus, becoming an end process procedure.</p>
    <p>This workflow habit needs to be addressed and better habits need to be formed to start at the beginning of design concept. Another habit is designers seek out print services towards the end process. And many of these services seem to give out information that is generalized or very vague on how to output a file, (i.e. .pdf) for a CMYK Digital Print(s). This leaves designers in the dark wondering how the final product is produced. And many times why we see varying results from the intention we created on our screen.</p>

    <h3>Improved Habits - Asking proper Questions</h3>
    <p>A proper question should be created during the planning phase of our design(s). Starting from what is this design(s) intention? Will it be for print? Or will it be for Electronic devices? Maybe it will be for both… Knowing how to ask these questions will help determine how to use color as a tool. This is only a small question in the process when we design. We need to ask ourselves one that has a larger answer. By asking, <blockquote>How is the initial setup of the studio, i.e. our computer the design(s) will be created within?</blockquote> I ask this question before design becomes a part of the equation.</p>
    <p>Knowing our computer configuration is set up to produce appropriate color is a key step to answer any of the above mentions of our design(s) intention.The proper setup and tools in our studio helps maintain color reproduction in hopes to prevent dramatic color shifts from Printer to Printer, Screen to Screen and Print to Screen and the opposite. If our screens have been calibrated and we have sought out the proper ICC profiles that generate color gamuts.</p>
    <p>Our questions become more relevant during the design process.  I understand not everyone can invest into a <a href="https://www.xrite.com/i1display-pro" target="_blank">X-Rite i1Display Pro <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> or <a href="http://spyder.datacolor.com/display-calibration/" target="_blank">Spyder Colorimeter <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>. Though I will say to save up and invest in one of these tools. This tool should be in the tool box for all designers or computer artists for all industries. These help us gain proper calibration of what we see so when we use the ICC profiles that manufactures and industry produce we can achieve stronger color accuracy. Calibration produces the capabilities of on screen proofing and help tremendously determining if the colors enhance or subtract from the final design.</p>

    <h3>RGB and CMYK - improving the Profiles for Digital Files</h3>
    <p>Many of us are lead to use that <a href="http://www.color.org/srgbprofiles.xalter">RGB Color Space Profile <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> and US Sheetfed Coated as a default profile in design programs should work just fine. Which I am not saying this is wrong. Moreover, understanding that this is just a start/default setting and knowing how to control and manipulate our programs to use such profiles is where we go next.</p>
    <p>For more information on RGB color space Don Hutcheson with <a href="http://www.hutchcolor.com/profiles.html" target="_blank">HutchColor <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> has created .icc profiles that will improve the RGB color gamut.</p>
    <p>Profiles for CMYK, use the version of the local regional standard such as FOGRA, <a href="http://www.idealliance.org/downloads/swop2013-and-gracol2013-icc-profiles" target="_blank">SWOP2013 or GRACoL2013 <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>. Or choose a CMYK reference you have confirmed to be within the gamut of the print system.</p>
    <p>CMYK profiles are a bit more tricky because the color is printed. And knowing the printer is a whole other topic. So here is my current process; I have a Print client that I have a extremely great relationship with. I took time to learn the printers they use and have calabrated for all the various media they can print on. I have also delved into what specs the Manufacturer recommends for design files when converted to CMYK. One digital printer wants a European Standard of color using the ISOcoated_v2_300_eci.icc profile. While another digital printer recommends the GRACoL2006_Coated1v2.icc. Knowing which printer allows me to use my programs to better output a file with a CMYK profile for printing. Taking the extra step to gain a good relationship has helped me produce quality results.</p>
    <p>When the unknown of the digital printer comes up, which happens more often than not. The <a href="http://www.idealliance.org/" target="_blank">ICC <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> has a profile that is an exchange for a <q>pure digital</q> process for .pdf/x output. And if we are so inclined IDEAlliance has a wonderful download called the <a href="http://www.idealliance.org/downloads/m1-implementation-kit-gracol-2013swop-2013m1cgats-21iso-15339-downloads" target="_blank"><q>M1 Implementation Kit</q> <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> which I would recommend downloading and reading all the documentation they have set up for use. They have catered to Adobe products, but these profiles can be used in other programs. And further the knowledge base they have a updated version of the book <a href="http://www.idealliance.org/products/guide-print-production-13" target="_blank">IDEAlliance Guide to Print Production 13.0 <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>. I have not read this so I cannot sway an opinion one way or not but I did order it and I’ll review it in a later blog.</p>
